@title Custom Title
@keywords custom, keywords
@description This page contains custom meta information

This page doesn't contain any headers so there's nothing that can be used as html page title.

To fix that PHP Flat-file Markdown Website has support for custom meta information (title, keywords, description). It can be specified rigth inside markdown document by using @ keywrods like this:
  
    @title Custom Title
    @keywords custom, keywords
    @description This page contains custom meta information
  
These keywords get parsed only when they are placed on single line and at the beginning of that line.
